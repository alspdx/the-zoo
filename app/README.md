# The Local Zoo

#### An application to track animals at the zoo _2018_

#### by **Adam Smith**

## Description

This application will allow zoo employees to input and track data about animals in the zoo. The user will be able to add a name, species, age, gender, diet, likes and dislikes, location in the zoo, and how many caretakers needed. The user will be able to see and edit a list of animals and the data about those animals. The user will be able to filter the list by age groups.



## Future Development

Given the time I would allow users to be able to search by typing potential attributes in part or whole to get a list of animals that match.

## Setup

  1. Open Terminal or Command Line.
  2. Change directories to where you would like to clone the files.
  3. Run
  `$ git clone https://github.com/alspdx/zoo.git`.
  4. Change directories to the 'zoo' directory.
  5. Run the following in the command line:

  $ gulp serve
  ```
